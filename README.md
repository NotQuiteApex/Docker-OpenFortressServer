# Open Fortress Server with Docker
My attempt at streamlining creating and deploying Open Fortress servers, because SteamCMD is a pain. Based off the ["official guide"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2090433448).

To pull everything necessary, pull with `git clone --recurse-submodules <GITHUB_URL_HERE>`.
